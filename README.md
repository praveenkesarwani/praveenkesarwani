### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<br>
<p>I am a Full Stack Developer with experience in building scalable and efficient web applications. 

Currently, I am working at <b>Eatclub (Box8)</b in Bangalore, where I am involved in developing end-to-end Vendor Management Modules. This includes the implementation of key features such as Procurement Order, Vendor Invoice, and Debit Notes. I have also played a pivotal role in developing Asset and Services Management Modules, including Service Request, Asset Transfer Request, and Supervisor. In these projects, I have independently handled the design and implementation of both the backend and frontend aspects.

With a strong command over technologies like <b>Angular, Node.js, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, and TypeScript</b>, I have designed and implemented robust backend architectures using RESTful APIs. I take pride in creating intuitive user interfaces that enhance the overall user experience in the Vendor Management Modules. Throughout my work, I have collaborated closely with cross-functional teams, gathering requirements and incorporating valuable feedback to deliver high-quality solutions.

Prior to my current role, I worked as a Full Stack Developer at UpGrad Jeet in Bangalore. During my tenure, I designed and implemented REST APIs and database schemas for daily and weekly current affairs listings. I also contributed to the integration of WhatsApp communication, resulting in improved customer engagement and a 20% increase in customer satisfaction and engagement. Additionally, I collaborated with MoEngage to implement a push notification service that automated notifications for upcoming classes, resulting in increased attendance.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a strong commitment to delivering high-quality software solutions while adhering to best practices in code organization, modularization, and maintainability. I thrive in collaborative environments, where I can contribute my technical expertise and work with diverse teams to achieve project goals. I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to enhance my skills and make a meaningful impact in the field of software development.</p>
